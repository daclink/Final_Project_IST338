A python game built with curses
This is, for the most part, a simple exercise in learning python curses.

MY hope is that I can make a game engine general enough to expand out to something more graphincally interesing.
Maybe even someting 8-bit!

I have the groundwork for an RPG started. So I will port most of that over here.
